				<h1>The GPM Charitable Trust</h1>
				<p>The Trust is an independent charity which exists to give support to 
				workers and their families in the Printing, Graphical, Papermaking and 
				Media industries. Former workers in these industries can also apply 
				for help and support.</p>
				<p>The object of the charity is to provide financial assistance to those 
				who may need it in a variety of situations. Applications can be 
				made by those who find themselves in need through sickness or 
				disablement or who require convalescence.</p>
				<p>Assistance can also be offered to support applicants through 
				retraining, skill enhancement, educational requirements especially 
				following redundancy or other reduction in income.</p>
				<p>The Trustees meet at regular intervals and can award grants to 
				applicants to help pay for goods, services or facilities.</p>
				<p>Over the last couple of years the Trust has helped individuals in many 
				different ways to improve their quality of life. It has:
