				<h1>History of the GPM Charitable Trust</h1>
				<p>The GPM Charitable Trust was formed on the 12th December 2001 bringing together the former 
					Lloyd Memorial and NATSOPA Trusts. In August 2010 the Sheridan Trust, a Manchester-based printing charity, 
					joined the GPM Charitable Trust.</p>
				<p>The Trustees all have links to printing, packaging and papermaking and have a wide knowledge of the industry. 
					They are dedicated to helping those that have worked in Graphical, Print, Media and Papermaking, 
					and their families, who are in need of financial help.</p>
				<p>Over the last twelve years the trust has made over 275 grants totalling over £158,000.</p>
