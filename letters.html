				<h1>Letters of Thanks</h1>
				<p class="letter">
					Thank you for giving me a grant towards my new Power Wheel Chair. So very touched by how kind you are.
					It will be life changing for me and give me back some independence I lost when my spinal cord was damaged.
					I really cannot express enough how grateful I am, the freedom it will provide and all because of your kindness and generosity.
					Thank you from the heart.<br />

					I personally would like to thank you on behalf of my husband for the donation of £1,000.
					This will pay for my husband's respite care.
					My husband has had Parkinson's disease for about 10 years now but his health has deteriorated considerably over the past year.
					Again very many thanks.<br />

					I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the committee for the generosity in awarding me this grant.
					I am enclosing a photograph, taken of myself of myself sitting on the scooter, which you have enabled me to purchase. 
					It has given me a new lease of life, and independence.
					Thanking you once again. <br />

					On behalf of Mrs VB and the entire family, this extremely generous award charity has made is absolutely fantastic

					This is just a short note of thank you for you and your fellow Trustees for considering and approving the financial grant of £500.

					My husband and I were thrilled to receive the cheque to help with the cost of our walk in shower, which has been a blessing.
					My knees have become too painful to lift my husband into a bath, and the shower will be a great help to him when I go into hospital for a knee replacement.
					Once again my husband and I would like to say how grateful we both are for your kindness.
					We find that it is gratifying there are still people willing to help.<br />
